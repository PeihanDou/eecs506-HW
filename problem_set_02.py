Parameters:

Returns:
    (int): The number of lines or words in <string>, depending on the choice

Explanation:
    You should use conditionals to determine what is returned by this function.
    If <operation> is "words", return the number of words in <string>. If
    <operation> is "lines", return the number of lines in <string>. If <operation>
    is neither, this function should return "Choose a correct operation".
